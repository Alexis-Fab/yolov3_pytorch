# Yolov3_pytorch

Yolov3 (+tiny) pythonic pytorch implementation.

Tested with pytorch 0.4.0 and python>3.5. Some basic tests are included in [tests](https://github.com/holli/yolov3_pytorch/tree/master/test) folder.

There are some good pytorch implementations previously but they were using original cfg files to create the model. This works well but it's harder to modify and test other approaches. This repo has a goal to have simple pythonic object oriented implementation that can be easily used as it is and also easy to modify the model.
